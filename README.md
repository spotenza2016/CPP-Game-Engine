# CPP-Game-Engine

## This project is no longer being worked on, being replaced by https://github.com/spotenza2016/Mimema

This is a personal project/challenge I work on occasionally attempting to build a basic game engine in C++ using only the SFML graphics library.

Currently, the basic game engine event loop, entities, and collision (utilizing a quad tree) have been implemented.
